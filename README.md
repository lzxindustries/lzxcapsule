# LZX Capsule
+/-12V +/-1A Low Noise EuroRack Power Supply

This is our open hardware design for a low noise EuroRack Power Supply. RevA of this design has been tested thoroughly and used in production here at LZX Industries.  Under full  +/-1A load, we measure ripple/noise at < 2mVpp.

Our main concern is that PCB routing best practices are followed carefully in any derivative works.  Study our implementation layout as well as the notes in the datasheets for TPS7A47 LDO regulators.
